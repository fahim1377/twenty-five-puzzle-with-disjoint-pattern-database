# twenty-five-puzzle-with-disjoint-pattern-database

In this project to compute heuristic i break puzzle into 4 parts and solve each part seperate using astar algorihtm to obtain the minimum 
move for goal 

4 parts are
goal1 = State([1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 11, 12, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],None)
goal2 = State([0, 0, 3, 4, 5, 0, 0, 8, 9, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],None)
goal3 = State([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 17, 18, 0, 0, 21, 22, 23, 0, 0],None)
goal4 = State([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 14, 15, 0, 0, 0, 19, 20, 0, 0, 0, 24,0],None)
